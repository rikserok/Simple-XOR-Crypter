# XOR .net crypter
⚠️ This project is for educational and research purposes only. Do not use it for malicious purposes!      
Right now it's poorly made, but I'll be adding more features and fixing everything soon. (the payload will be inside the exe and more)     
when i upload the file the crypter will probably get detected but its not that hard to refud it yourself.     
The crypter only supports .net files.

#🛡️ Detection Status
As of right now (26 May 2025) the crypted file is undetectable on most AV's runtime and scantime.

# 📁 How to use
1. Open the crypter and select the file you want to encrypt.
2. Click "Encrypt" to generate the encrypted payload.
3. Place the encrypted payload in the same directory as the decrypter (stub).
4. Run the stub — it will automatically decrypt the payload and execute it at runtime.
